# StrataScratch Daily Python Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains daily Python challenges solved using the StrataScratch platform. The challenges cover a variety of Python concepts, including data manipulation, machine learning, and automation.

## Repository Structure
- **Python_Solutions/**: Contains Python scripts for each challenge.
- **Notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations and outputs.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## Problem Statement
Each challenge involves solving real-world Python problems from various datasets. A typical problem includes:
- Data analysis and visualization
- Algorithmic problem-solving
- Performance optimization and automation

## Example Solution
### Problem:
Calculate the total number of interactions and the total number of contents created for each customer. Include all interaction types and content types in your calculations.

### Python Solution:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrames
customer_interactions = pd.DataFrame({
    'customer_id': [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10],
    'total_interactions': [4, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 4, 1]
})

user_content = pd.DataFrame({
    'customer_id': [2, 4, 6, 8, 10],
    'total_contents': [4, 2, 3, 2, 1]
})

# Merging the data
result = customer_interactions.merge(user_content, on='customer_id', how='left').fillna(0)
print(result)
```

### Output:
| customer_id | total_interactions | total_contents |
|-------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 2           | 4                  | 4             |
| 3           | 2                  | 0             |
| 4           | 3                  | 2             |
| 5           | 2                  | 0             |
| 6           | 1                  | 3             |
| 7           | 4                  | 0             |
| 8           | 4                  | 2             |
| 10          | 1                  | 1             |
