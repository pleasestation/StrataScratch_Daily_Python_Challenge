    "## Conclusion of User Activity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of user activity within the first 30 days of signup reveals the following insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Activity Frequency**: Some users engage in multiple activities shortly after signing up, while others exhibit limited or no activity during the first 30 days.\n",
    "- **Engagement Window**: The 30-day window is useful in understanding how quickly new users start interacting with the platform. However, itâ€™s clear that users who sign up on later dates may have less activity due to the relatively short observation period.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improve User Engagement**: For users with limited activity within 30 days, consider implementing targeted engagement strategies such as onboarding tutorials, reminders, or incentives for frequent usage.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Expand the Activity Window**: The 30-day window is useful but may not capture longer-term engagement trends. Extending the observation period could provide more comprehensive insights into user behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Personalize User Experience**: Based on activity patterns, offer personalized recommendations or support to boost activity levels, especially for users showing low engagement within the first month.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Monitor User Retention**: Regularly analyze user activity and retention metrics to understand the effectiveness of engagement strategies and refine them based on observed trends."
